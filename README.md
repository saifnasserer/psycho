Core Principles

Scope razor-thin → 3–5 core user stories only. Everything else → backlog.

Architecture on 1 page → state mgmt = Cubit, MVVM folder structure (features/*, core/*, data/*, ui/*), data flow diagram.

UI ≠ Logic → Screens are dumb; logic in ViewModels/Cubits; data in Repositories.

Pick stable packages → justify choices, lock versions in pubspec.yaml.

Models evolve → use freezed/json_serializable, nullable fields, safe migrations.

Minimal tests → trip-wire unit tests on critical logic, smoke test app boots.

Version control → branches + short PRs + light reviews.

CI/CD → GitHub Actions runs lint/tests + builds APK/TestFlight.

Feature flags → simple config JSON/env; secrets in CI.

Wearables staged → start with Sheets/API mock → abstract repos → swap for real APIs later.

Observability → Crashlytics/Sentry + minimal usage logs.

Performance budget → first render <2s, lazy lists, test on low-end Android.

Security/privacy (MVP-level) → Firebase Auth, minimal PII, consent screen.

Theming → single theme file, adaptive layout.

Docs = 1 page → README with run steps, diagram, keys, “where to change what.”

Track tech debt → TODOs in backlog, size tagged (S/M/L).

Release small & reversible → weekly tags, changelog, pilot builds.

Team cadence → 2×/week sync (20min): progress, blockers, next tasks.

Post-pilot flexibility → add/remove features via flags, safe migrations.

Definition of Done → works Android/iOS, errors handled, logs/analytics in place, tests pass, docs updated.


i think we should create a filte named responsive and use it's valuses across the app to maintain responsiveness

**1. Make the complex simple**

Your job is to turn something scientific and intimidating (HRV, wearables, AI) into something human.

- Don’t overload therapists with numbers.
- Give them clear states: *calm, stressed, recovering*.
- Keep raw data in the background for those who want it.

**2. Design is how it works**

AI and wearables should feel like *magic*, not technology.

- The AI chat should feel like a colleague, not a robot.
- Wearables should feel like a bridge to the body, not a gadget.
- The therapist should feel supported, not overwhelmed.

**3. Create emotional connection**

You’re not showing data; you’re creating *emotion*.

- Progress should feel encouraging.
- Negative states should offer guidance, not fear.
- Design must breathe calm: soft colors, clean typography, minimal clutter.

**4. Focus on experience**

Every screen should answer: *“What does this give me right now?”*

- Therapist: is this technique working?
- Client: how do I feel, and what can I do?
- Both: the AI assistant as a *friend*.

**5. Details matter**

- AI should “pause to think” → feels human.
- Wearable integration → one click, no setup.
- Reports → beautiful, minimalist, Apple-like.

**6. Bridge fear and trust**

Therapists may fear machines replacing humans. Clients may fear confronting data.

- Always emphasize: **the human is in charge**.
- Technology is the supportive background.

> “Hide the complexity. Show only clarity, beauty, and care.”

## 🎨 Suggested Color Palette (Apple-inspired calm + trust + health)

- **Serene Blue (#3A7CA5)** → calm, professional, trustworthy
- **Mint Green (#7ED6C1)** → health, vitality, growth
- **Soft Lavender (#C8BFE7)** → balance, psychological safety
- **Warm Sand (#F2E8DC)** → grounding, neutrality
- **Pure White (#FFFFFF)** → clarity, space
- **Charcoal Gray (#2E2E2E)** → typography, focus

👉 Accent colors: *blue/green for positive states*, *lavender for reflection*, *sand/white as base*.

## 🖼️ Moodboard Directions

- **Style:** Apple minimalism (clean layouts, lots of whitespace, simple but elegant typography like SF Pro or Inter).
- **Imagery:** abstract waves, soft gradients, biometrics rendered as *living elements* (not cold graphs).
- **Icons:** line-based, rounded corners, lightweight.
- **Motion:** smooth micro-animations (gentle fades, subtle breathing effect for calm).
- **AI Chat:** designed as a *conversation with care* → like iMessage but warmer, with thoughtful spacing and soft colors.
- **Reports:** not tables, but cards with short insights, supported by icons/emojis.
